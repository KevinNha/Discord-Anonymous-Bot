## Misc. Information
This bot was created during nw HackCamp 2020 by Reo and Kevin. The idea originated from Reo. This app was made so that students that are too shy to speak up can anonymous share their feedback. This also extends to employees in a company. 

This bot allows non-biased, non-prejudice receival of feedback.

Currently, we have no method of filtering inappropriate or NSFW messages. As such, the Discord server moderators should delete any messages if necessary.

Currently hosted on Heroku.
